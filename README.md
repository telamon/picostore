# picostore (block-engine)

This engine takes consensus rules in JavaScript.
Then it consumes blocks, and maintains a local view
of the decentralized state.

It wouldn't be wrong to call it an indexer,
but it would only be half of it.

Because there's also a garbarge collector.

> __warn: instructions below are outdated__

## Use

```bash
$ npm i @telamon/picostore browser-level memory-level
```

Starter example using bundled DiffMemory:

```js
import { Feed } from 'picofeed'
import { MemoryLevel } from 'memory-level'
import { Store, DiffMemory } from 'picoengine'

// First an identity and a feed/chain
const { pk: pubkey, sk: secret } = Feed.signPair()
const feed = new Feed()

// Create a database and pass it to the engine
const db = new MemoryLevel('app', { keyEncoding: 'view', valueEncoding: 'view' })
const store = new Store(db)

// Register a collection and it's controller
const collection = engine.register('peers', DiffMemory)

// Restore state from previous boot/pageload
await store.load()


// Eventually you'll want to create your own subclass of `Memory`
// but the bundled `DiffMemory`-class is a good starting point
// because it provides the function `mutate()`

await collection.mutate(feed, currentValue => {
  return {
    name: 'Bob',
    location: 'bahamas',
    occupation: 'fishwarrior'
  }
}, secret)

await collection.readState(pubkey) // => { name: 'Bob', ...}

// TODO: transmit feed.buffer to a buddy
// and your local state will be replicated
// on their end
debugger
```

Please keep an eye on the [picostack](https://github.com/telamon/picostack) repo,
there will be more complete examples and starting points.
